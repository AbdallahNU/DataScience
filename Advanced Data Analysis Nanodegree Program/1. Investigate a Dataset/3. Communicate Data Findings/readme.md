# FIFA Data Exploration
## by Abdallah Mahmoud Elsayed


## Dataset

> The data is is taken from kaggle (we can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19), It contains alot of informations about more than 18K plater in fifa19 game.
 I chose only some of these informations to use in my analysis. I did some cleaning on height, weight, Wage, Value to make them numbers for me to use.


## Summary of Findings

> I found that player Overall is strongly related to his value. Ball control, Position, and body type are also correlated to the value. International Reputation is also correlated to value. and all the previous variables I included them into my explanatory visualization. Other variables like preferred foot and Height, Weight.. etc were not that interesting so I did't include them in  explanatory.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In my exploration, I found that Values take huge range of values and need to be transormed to log scale to plot all my visualizations. I focused first on my main variable (Overall), plot my value and overall disrtibutions, then I go to the relation between them and other variables.
